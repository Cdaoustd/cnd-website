        Talks will be selected by a committee of cloud native evangelists who 
        have been active participants in local communities and have years of 
        industry experience. Four of the eight talks selected will be presented 
        by local experts. The single-track event will be bilingual and we will 
        do our best to select equal amounts of English and French content.
