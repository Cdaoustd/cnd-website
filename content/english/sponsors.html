        The organizers of Cloud Native Day 2019 would like to thank our sponsors, 
        without whom this event would not be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sponsoring Cloud Native Day gives your organization an opportunity to 
        speak with developers, technical leaders, and decision makers from 
        companies of all sizes and industries. Whether your goals include 
        recruiting new talent, opening new markets, or connecting with your 
        existing customers, this event will be the place to have those 
        conversations with experts and leaders in tech innovation.
    </p>
    <p>
        Generate brand awareness in the Cloud Native community and have the 
        opportunity to engage with participants about about your organizationâ€™s 
        products and services. Engage with and support  the ecosystem behind 
        many of the most popular open source projects that bring cloud native 
        project communities together.
    </p>
    <p>
        This opportunity gives you access to local grassroots communities, which 
        are an integral part of the Quebec market, and the ability to associate 
        your brand with one of the fastest growing technology communities.
